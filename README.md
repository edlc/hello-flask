# hello-flask
## Capstone Project Overview
This is the final project of my Udacity Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. I developed a CI/CD pipeline for a micro service application with rolling deployment.
The pipeline builds a docker container and deploys it to my AWS Kubernetes as a Service.

### Project Specs:
  * AWS Cloud
  * Jenkins master instance (t2.micro)
  * AWS EKS Cluster
  * 2 Worker Nodes (t2.medium)
  * Flask-based Python App
